faqs:
  - question: "How do I use the fever medicine dosage calculator?"
    answer: "Enter your child's weight in kg and age, and the calculator will automatically compute accurate dosages (in mL) for common fever medicines. Weight-based calculation is the most accurate method, so knowing your child's current weight is essential."
  - question: "Are the calculator's dosage calculations accurate?"
    answer: "The calculator follows AAP recommended dosages (acetaminophen 10-15mg/kg, ibuprofen 5-10mg/kg) and divides by each product's actual concentration (mg/mL) to calculate mL. Maximum single-dose limits and age restrictions are automatically applied."
  - question: "Why are there age restrictions?"
    answer: "Acetaminophen is not recommended under 4 months, and ibuprofen under 6 months, due to insufficient safety data. The calculator automatically blocks results for ages below these thresholds."

## Why I Built This Fever Medicine Dosage Calculator

Last Thursday at 3 AM, Yunseul was burning up.

I have seen countless children with fevers during my time in the ER, but when it is your own child spiking an unexpected fever, you are just a panicking dad.

I dug through the medicine cabinet and pulled out the Tylenol... then my mind went blank.

> "If she is 40 months old and 15 kg, how many mL? Wait, was this Tylenol or ibuprofen?"

I frantically searched on my phone.

- Apps full of ads and unreliable information
- Sign-up pages demanding personal data
- Overly complicated dosing calculations

Yunseul kept crying, time was ticking, and all I needed was one thing:

**"How many mL should I give her right now?"**

That night, after finally calculating the dose, giving her the medicine, and putting her back to sleep, I thought:

*"I can't be the only parent going through this."*

## The Simplest Tool, Built by an ER Doctor

I started working on it the very next day. Medically accurate, but as simple as possible to use.

### Three Principles Behind the Calculator

1. **No app installation needed** -- just a link
2. **No sign-up required** -- zero personal data collected
3. **Minimal input** -- only weight and age

Enter 15 kg and 40 months, and you get:

| Product | Single Dose | Dosing Interval |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Tylenol Suspension, Champ Syrup (red) | 4.7-7 mL | Every 4-6 hours |
| Ibuprofen Syrup | 3.8-7.5 mL | Every 6-8 hours |
| Dexibuprofen Syrup | 6.3-8.8 mL | Every 6-8 hours |

Everything is calculated automatically and displayed on screen.

### The Calculation Basis

The calculator follows recommendations from the Korean Pediatric Society, each product's official prescribing information, and AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) guidelines.

- Acetaminophen: **10-15 mg/kg** per dose (every 4-6 hours, maximum 5 times per day)
- Ibuprofen: **5-10 mg/kg** per dose (every 6-8 hours, from 6 months of age)
- Dexibuprofen: **5-7 mg/kg** per dose (every 6-8 hours)

> **Important**: Weight-based dosing is the most accurate. Calculate using your child's weight, not their age.

## What I Learned Raising a Child

"Golden time" does not have to be something dramatic.

The difference between giving medicine within 10 minutes versus 30 minutes when your child has a fever may not be medically significant. But **the difference in the parent's anxiety and the child's suffering is enormous.**

I built this calculator to save that time.

## Important Reminders

This calculator is a **supplementary tool** only.

In the following situations, **you must seek medical care**:

- Any fever in an infant under 3 months old
- Fever of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher lasting more than 3 days
- Seizures, decreased consciousness, or severe fussiness
- Fever that does not respond to fever medicine
- Signs of dehydration (decreased urine, dry lips, etc.)

In my clinical experience, **a parent's "gut feeling" is often more accurate** than the thermometer reading.

**If something feels wrong, do not hesitate -- go to the doctor.**
