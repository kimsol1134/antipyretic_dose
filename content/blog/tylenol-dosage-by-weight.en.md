faqs:
  - question: "How much Tylenol should I give my 22lb (10kg) child?"
    answer: "For Children's Tylenol (160mg/5mL or 32mg/mL), approximately 3.1-4.7mL. The recommended dose is calculated as weight x 10-15mg/kg divided by the product concentration. Use our dosage calculator for exact amounts."
  - question: "What is the Tylenol dosage formula?"
    answer: "Dose (mL) = Weight (kg) x Dose (mg/kg) / Concentration (mg/mL). For example, for a 33lb (15kg) child using Children's Tylenol (32mg/mL) at 15mg/kg: 15 x 15 / 32 = 7.0mL maximum recommended dose."
  - question: "Should I use the age chart or weight chart for dosing?"
    answer: "Weight-based dosing is more accurate because children of the same age can vary significantly in weight. The AAP recommends weight-based dosing. Use the age chart on the package only as a reference and calculate based on your child's actual weight."

## 3 AM, Standing Over a Feverish Child

It's 3 AM. My daughter Yunseul suddenly wakes up crying. The moment I touch her forehead, I know. Fever. The thermometer reads 39.2°C (102.6°F). I grab the Tylenol right away, but then the real question hits.

"How much does she weigh now? Was the dose I gave last time correct?"

The dosing chart on the back of the box only lists doses **by age**: "1-2 years: X mL." But should an 18lb (8kg) child and a 29lb (13kg) child of the same age really get the same dose? Of course not.

When I worked in the ER, we always calculated pediatric fever medicine doses based on **weight**. The age-based chart is a rough guide at best. For accurate dosing, weight-based calculation is essential. That is why I put together this weight-based Tylenol dosage chart so that even at 3 AM, with a foggy head, you can look it up instantly.

## Why Weight-Based Dosing?

Even among 2-year-olds, one child may weigh 22lb (10kg) while another weighs 31lb (14kg). A medication's effectiveness and safety depend on the amount of drug per unit of body weight, expressed as **mg/kg**. Age-based charts are built around average weights, so they are inherently inaccurate for children who fall above or below the average.

Both the **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)** and the **Korean Pediatric Society** recommend calculating pediatric antipyretic doses **based on weight**.

> **Formula**: `Weight (kg) x Dose (mg/kg) / Concentration (mg/mL) = Dose (mL)`

The recommended dose for Tylenol (acetaminophen) is **10-15 mg/kg**. You can adjust within this range based on your child's condition.

## Children's Tylenol 160mg/5mL (32mg/mL) Dosage Chart

Children's Tylenol Suspension at this concentration contains **32mg of acetaminophen per mL**. This is the standard concentration widely available in the US (labeled as 160mg/5mL). It can be used from **4 months of age** and older.

> Calculation: `Weight (kg) x 10mg / 32 = minimum mL` to `Weight (kg) x 15mg / 32 = maximum mL`

| Weight | Min Dose (10mg/kg) | Max Dose (15mg/kg) | Dose Range (mL) |
|:------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| 5 kg (11 lb) | 50mg | 75mg | 1.6 - 2.3 |
| 6 kg (13 lb) | 60mg | 90mg | 1.9 - 2.8 |
| 7 kg (15 lb) | 70mg | 105mg | 2.2 - 3.3 |
| 8 kg (18 lb) | 80mg | 120mg | 2.5 - 3.8 |
| 9 kg (20 lb) | 90mg | 135mg | 2.8 - 4.2 |
| 10 kg (22 lb) | 100mg | 150mg | 3.1 - 4.7 |
| 12 kg (26 lb) | 120mg | 180mg | 3.8 - 5.6 |
| 14 kg (31 lb) | 140mg | 210mg | 4.4 - 6.6 |
| 16 kg (35 lb) | 160mg | 240mg | 5.0 - 7.5 |
| 18 kg (40 lb) | 180mg | 270mg | 5.6 - 8.4 |
| 20 kg (44 lb) | 200mg | 300mg | 6.3 - 9.4 |
| 25 kg (55 lb) | 250mg | 375mg | 7.8 - 11.7 |
| 30 kg (66 lb) | 300mg | 450mg* | 9.4 - 14.1 |

> *At 30kg (66lb), the 15mg/kg dose equals 450mg, which is within the single-dose maximum of 650mg. For children over approximately 43kg (95lb), the single-dose maximum of 650mg (= 20.3mL) applies as the upper limit.

## Children's Tylenol 50mg/mL (Higher Concentration) Dosage Chart

Some markets carry a higher-concentration Children's Tylenol Suspension at **50mg of acetaminophen per mL**. This formulation is **1.5 times more concentrated** than the standard product, so the mL amount per dose is smaller.

> **For children aged 2 years (24 months) and older.**

> Calculation: `Weight (kg) x 10mg / 50 = minimum mL` to `Weight (kg) x 15mg / 50 = maximum mL`

| Weight | Min Dose (10mg/kg) | Max Dose (15mg/kg) | Dose Range (mL) |
|:------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| 10 kg (22 lb) | 100mg | 150mg | 2.0 - 3.0 |
| 12 kg (26 lb) | 120mg | 180mg | 2.4 - 3.6 |
| 14 kg (31 lb) | 140mg | 210mg | 2.8 - 4.2 |
| 16 kg (35 lb) | 160mg | 240mg | 3.2 - 4.8 |
| 18 kg (40 lb) | 180mg | 270mg | 3.6 - 5.4 |
| 20 kg (44 lb) | 200mg | 300mg | 4.0 - 6.0 |
| 25 kg (55 lb) | 250mg | 375mg | 5.0 - 7.5 |
| 30 kg (66 lb) | 300mg | 450mg* | 6.0 - 9.0 |

> *At 30kg, the single-dose maximum (650mg) still applies, same as the standard concentration product.

> **Warning**: The standard (32mg/mL) and higher concentration (50mg/mL) products have different concentrations! When switching between products, you must recalculate the dose. For more details, see [Tylenol 100mL vs 200mL: What's the Difference?](/en/blog/tylenol-100-vs-200-concentration).

## Dosing Interval and Daily Limits

| Parameter | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| Minimum interval | 4 hours |
| Maximum doses per day | 5 |
| Maximum daily dose | 75 mg/kg/day |
| Maximum single dose | 650 mg |

For example, a 22lb (10kg) child has a maximum daily dose of 750mg. Using the standard concentration product (32mg/mL), this is approximately 23.4mL per day; using the higher concentration product (50mg/mL), approximately 15.0mL per day, divided across multiple doses.

> Maintain at least 4 hours between doses, give no more than 5 doses per day, and never exceed the daily maximum of 75mg/kg.

## Safety Checklist Before Giving Medicine

Always verify the following before administering Tylenol.

- **Confirm the weight is current** - Use a recently measured weight. A weight from several months ago may be inaccurate.
- **Check the product concentration** - Standard (160mg/5mL or 32mg/mL) vs. higher concentration (50mg/mL) are NOT the same! Always verify the mg/mL on the label.
- **Record the time of each dose** - Write down when you gave medicine so you can calculate the next safe dosing time.
- **Shake the suspension well before use** - If the medication has settled, the concentration will not be uniform.
- **Never give another acetaminophen product at the same time** - Other products like Champ Syrup (red) or store-brand acetaminophen contain the same active ingredient. Taking them together results in a double dose.

## Summary

1. **Pediatric Tylenol dosing should be based on weight, not age** for the greatest accuracy.
2. Use the formula **Weight (kg) x 10-15 mg/kg / Concentration (mg/mL)** to calculate the dose in mL.
3. **Standard (32mg/mL) and higher concentration (50mg/mL) products have different concentrations**, so always recalculate when switching products.
4. **Maintain at least 4 hours between doses, no more than 5 doses per day, and do not exceed 75mg/kg/day.**
5. For precise calculations, use our [dosage calculator](/en). Just enter your child's weight and age for an instant result.
