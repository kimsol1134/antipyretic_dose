  - question: "What is the difference between Tylenol 100mL and 200mL products?"
    answer: "The key difference is concentration. The 100mL product contains 32mg/mL, while the 200mL product contains 50mg/mL. Giving the same volume (mL) of the 200mL product delivers about 1.6 times more medication, so you must recalculate dosage when switching products."
  - question: "What happens if I use the wrong concentration's dosage?"
    answer: "If you give the 100mL product's volume using the 200mL product, you risk overdose (about 56% more than intended). If you give the 200mL product's volume using the 100mL product, the dose will be insufficient (only about 64% of needed amount). Always recalculate based on concentration."

## This Mistake Is More Common Than You Think

"Wait — last time the calculator said 5 mL, but now it says 3 mL?"

If you just bought a new bottle of Tylenol from the pharmacy and the calculated dose looks different from what you are used to, it may be because **you got a different product**.

## The Key Question: Same Volume (mL) = Same Dose?

**No!**

Children's Tylenol suspension comes in **two different concentrations**:

| Product | Concentration | Acetaminophen per 1 mL |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| Tylenol **100 mL** | 32 mg/mL | 32 mg |
| Tylenol **200 mL** | **50 mg/mL** | 50 mg |

**The 200 mL product is about 1.6 times more concentrated!**

> **Note for readers in other countries**: Acetaminophen concentration differences are not unique to the Korean market. In the United States, infant acetaminophen drops were historically sold at a much higher concentration (80 mg/0.8 mL) than children's liquid (160 mg/5 mL = 32 mg/mL). The infant drops were discontinued and reformulated in 2011 to match the children's concentration (160 mg/5 mL) precisely because of overdose risks from concentration confusion. The Korean market still has two distinct concentrations (32 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL) available simultaneously, making the risk of mix-ups very real.

## Why Is This Dangerous?

For example, for a 12 kg (26 lb) child:

| Product | Recommended Dose | Acetaminophen Amount |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 100 mL product | about 5 mL | 160 mg |
| 200 mL product | about **3.2 mL** | 160 mg |

What if you give the 100 mL product's dose (5 mL) using the 200 mL product?

> **5 mL x 50 mg = 250 mg** — that is **1.56 times the intended dose, a significant overdose!**

And the reverse is also a problem. If you give the 200 mL product's dose (3.2 mL) using the 100 mL product:

> **3.2 mL x 32 mg = 102.4 mg** — only **64% of the needed dose**, meaning the medicine may not adequately reduce the fever.

## A Close Call

When Yunseul had a fever, our usual 100 mL bottle of Tylenol ran out, so I rushed to the pharmacy. But that pharmacy only had the 200 mL product in stock.

Back home, I was about to give the usual 5 mL when something on the label caught my eye.

**"50 mg/mL"**

I paused, recalculated, and gave the correct smaller volume. But if it had been the middle of the night and I was half-asleep, I might well have just given 5 mL without thinking.

## Product Switch Safety Checklist

**Check the label for concentration (mg/mL)**
- 32 mg/mL = 100 mL product
- 50 mg/mL = 200 mL product

**Always recalculate the dose**
- Never carry over the previous product's dose volume
- Use the [dosage calculator](/en) — select the correct product and recalculate

**Do not mix products**
- Use only one product at a time
- Label any remaining medicine with its concentration

## Which Product Should I Choose?

| Situation | Recommended Product |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **4 months to under 2 years old** | 100 mL product (32 mg/mL) |
| **2 years and older** | Either 100 mL or 200 mL |
| **Child who struggles to take medicine** | 200 mL product (smaller volume needed) |

> The 200 mL product's higher concentration means your child needs to take a **smaller volume** for the same effect, which can be helpful for children who resist taking medicine.

## Maximum Daily Dose Differs Too

Maximum daily dose (based on 75 mg/kg/day, for a 12 kg / 26 lb child):

| Product | Max mL per Day |
|---------|---------------|
| 100 mL product | about 28 mL |
| 200 mL product | about 18 mL |

**The same number of mL delivers very different amounts of medication** — always keep this in mind.

## What About Other Fever Medicines?

Good news: ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil), dexibuprofen, and Champ syrup each come in only one concentration.

| Product | Concentration |
|---------|--------------|
| Ibuprofen syrup | 20 mg/mL (standard) |
| Dexibuprofen syrup | 12 mg/mL (standard) |
| Champ syrup (Red) | 32 mg/mL (standard) |

**Tylenol is the one that requires extra attention** due to its dual-concentration product line.

## Summary

1. **Tylenol 100 mL and 200 mL have different concentrations** (32 vs. 50 mg/mL)
2. **When switching products, always recalculate the dose**
3. Giving the same mL volume from the wrong product risks **overdose or underdose**
4. Verify the correct dose using the [dosage calculator](/en)
