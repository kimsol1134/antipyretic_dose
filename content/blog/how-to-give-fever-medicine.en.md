  - question: "Should I re-dose if my baby vomits right after taking fever medicine?"
    answer: "If most of the medicine was vomited within 15 minutes, you can give the same dose again. If 15-30 minutes passed, some may have been absorbed so it's safer not to re-dose. After 30+ minutes, most is absorbed — do not re-dose."
  - question: "What's the most accurate way to measure fever medicine syrup?"
    answer: "Always use the oral syringe or measuring cup that comes with the product. Kitchen spoons vary too much in volume. When using an oral syringe, place it against the inside of the cheek and push slowly in small amounts."
  - question: "When should I use suppositories?"
    answer: "Use suppositories when the child is vomiting too much to keep syrup down, or when the child is sleeping with a high fever. Suppositories are absorbed rectally and provide the same effect as oral medication. Never use both oral and suppository forms of the same medicine simultaneously."

## The First Time I Gave Yunseul Fever Medicine

Yunseul was about 8 months old when she had her first fever. The thermometer read 38.9°C (102°F), and I immediately reached for the Tylenol suspension. In the emergency room, I had given fever medicine to countless children. Measure precisely with an oral syringe, place it against the inside of the cheek, push slowly. It was second nature.

But with my own child, everything was different.

The moment the syringe tip touched her lips, she whipped her head away. When I managed to get some in, she blew it right back out. Holding a crying, squirming Yunseul, medicine all over her clothes, with no idea how much actually went in — my wife and I were both drenched in sweat. The doctor who so deftly gave medicine to children in the ER was now a fumbling first-time dad in front of his own baby.

After that day, through plenty of trial and error — adjusting positions, timing, and tools — I eventually found what works. Today I want to share those practical lessons along with the medical evidence behind them.

## Oral Syrup Administration: The Basics

### The Right Tool Makes All the Difference

When giving liquid fever medicine to a child, your choice of measuring tool determines accuracy.

| Tool | Accuracy | Recommendation |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Oral syringe | Excellent | Best choice |
| Measuring spoon (included with medicine) | Moderate | Acceptable |
| Kitchen spoon | Poor | Never use |

> **Kitchen spoons vary from 3-7 mL in volume.** According to an NIH study, parents who used spoon-based measurements had twice the medication error rate compared to those using mL-based measuring devices.

Oral syringes are readily available at any pharmacy. If you ask when buying fever medicine for the first time, most pharmacies will provide one for free. Once you have one, it will last until your child outgrows liquid medicine, so make sure to get one.

### Step-by-Step Syrup Administration

1. **Shake the suspension thoroughly** (at least 10 seconds, vigorously up and down)
2. **Draw the exact amount into the oral syringe** (check the markings at eye level)
3. **Hold your child in a semi-upright position** (never give medicine while lying flat — risk of aspiration)
4. **Place the syringe tip against the inside of the cheek (between tongue and cheek) and push slowly**
5. **Wait for the child to swallow before giving more** (do not push it all in at once)
6. **Offer a small sip of water afterward** (to rinse any remaining medicine from the mouth)

> **Key point**: Do not aim the syringe toward the back of the throat. This can trigger the gag reflex, causing coughing or vomiting. Always aim toward the **inside of the cheek**.

The most effective tip I discovered with Yunseul was pushing in very small amounts — about 0.3-0.5 mL at a time. Pushing too much at once dramatically increases the chance of spitting it out.

## Before or After Food? Timing by Drug

Different fever medicines have different relationships with food. In particular, ibuprofen-class drugs should always be given after eating to protect the stomach lining.

| Medicine | Timing with Food | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Tylenol (Acetaminophen) | Anytime | Minimal stomach irritation |
| Ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) | **After food** | Protects GI lining |
| Dexibuprofen | **After food** | NSAID class, needs GI protection |
| Suppository | Anytime | Absorbed rectally, GI not involved |

> **Practical tip**: If it is 2 AM and your child needs ibuprofen but refuses to eat anything, even a few sips of milk or a spoonful of yogurt will help. Giving ibuprofen-class drugs on a completely empty stomach can cause significant stomach irritation. If your child truly will not eat anything, consider switching to acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.

## What to Do When Your Child Vomits After Medicine

You've just given the medicine and your child goes "bleh" and throws it all up. Every parent has been there — it is one of the most stressful moments. "Should I give it again? Was it already absorbed? What if I cause an overdose?"

### Re-Dosing Decision Guide

The key factors are **how much time has passed since the dose** and **whether you can see medicine in the vomit**.

| Time After Dose | Medicine Visible in Vomit? | Action |
|----------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Within 15-20 minutes | Yes (check color/taste) | Give the same dose again |
| 20-60 minutes | Uncertain | Give half dose or wait |
| After 60 minutes | — | Do NOT re-dose; wait for next scheduled dose |

Oral fever medicine begins significant absorption about 30 minutes after administration, and by 60 minutes most of it is absorbed. If vomiting occurs after 60 minutes, the medicine is already in the system and re-dosing could result in an overdose.

> **If vomiting is persistent**: Do not keep trying oral medication. Strongly consider **switching to a suppository (rectal form)**.

## Suppository Administration Guide

Many parents feel uneasy about the word "suppository." But in certain situations, suppositories are a far more effective and reliable route of administration than oral syrup.

### When to Use Suppositories

- **Persistent vomiting** — oral medicine cannot stay down
- **Child refuses oral medicine completely** — forcing it in risks aspiration
- **Rapid absorption needed** — rectal mucosa partially bypasses first-pass liver metabolism

Suppositories deliver medication through the rectal mucosa, bypassing the digestive system entirely. The main advantage is reliable drug delivery even when the child is vomiting heavily.

### Step-by-Step Suppository Insertion

1. **Wash your hands thoroughly**
2. **Warm the tip of the suppository slightly** by rubbing the pointed end with your finger (body heat softens the surface, making insertion much easier)
3. **Lay your child on their side** (gently pull their knees toward their chest)
4. **Insert the suppository pointed end first into the rectum** (about one finger-joint deep)
5. **Hold the buttocks together for at least 10 seconds** (the child will reflexively try to push it out immediately after insertion)
6. **Maintain the position for 2-3 minutes** (until the suppository begins to melt and absorb)

> **Dosage is the same as oral.** Suppository dosing is also calculated by weight. You can check suppository dosing along with oral dosing using the [dosage calculator](/en).

## 5 Common Mistakes Parents Make

### Mistake 1: Measuring with Kitchen Spoons

When the measuring device that came with the medicine is nowhere to be found, parents resort to dinner spoons or teaspoons. Kitchen spoons vary from **3 to 7 mL** depending on the manufacturer and design. An NIH study found that **over 40% of parents who used spoons administered inaccurate doses**. An oral syringe eliminates this problem entirely.

### Mistake 2: Not Shaking the Suspension

In a hurry, or simply not knowing, some parents pour straight from the bottle without shaking. Liquid suspensions contain the active ingredient as **fine particles suspended** in liquid. Over time, these particles settle to the bottom of the bottle.

- Without shaking: **the first doses are too weak, and the last doses are dangerously concentrated**
- **Always shake vigorously up and down for at least 10 seconds** to distribute the medication evenly before each dose

### Mistake 3: Mixing Into a Large Amount of Juice

"My child won't take medicine, so I'll mix it into juice." Mixing into a small amount (30 mL or less) is acceptable. But mixing into 200 mL of juice? Your child might drink half and say "all done!" — meaning only half the dose was actually taken.

> **Rule**: If you must mix medicine into a drink, use only a **small amount that the child will definitely finish completely**. Better yet, give the medicine first, then offer their favorite drink as a chaser.

### Mistake 4: Refrigerating the Medicine

"Doesn't medicine last longer in the fridge?" For food, yes — but **liquid fever medicine suspensions should NOT be refrigerated.** Cold temperatures cause the drug particles in the suspension to settle out (precipitate), making it difficult to maintain a uniform concentration. Even vigorous shaking may not fully re-suspend the particles.

- **Correct storage**: Room temperature (59-77°F / 15-25°C), away from direct sunlight
- If indoor temperatures exceed 86°F (30°C) in summer, find a cool spot but avoid the refrigerator

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Expiration After Opening

The expiration date on the medicine box is for the **unopened** product. Once opened, exposure to air reduces drug stability.

| Type | Shelf Life After Opening |
|------|------------------------|
| Commercial bottle (e.g., Tylenol) | **6 months after opening** |
| Hospital-dispensed (repackaged) | **1 month after opening** |

Hospital-dispensed medicines that have been repackaged in non-sterile conditions have a higher risk of contamination. Keeping leftover medicine for months "just in case" is risky.

## Summary

1. **An oral syringe** dramatically reduces dosing errors. Never use a kitchen spoon.
2. **Acetaminophen can be given with or without food**; **ibuprofen/dexibuprofen must be given after food**.
3. Re-dosing after vomiting depends on **time elapsed and whether medicine is visible in vomit**. Do not re-dose if vomiting occurs after 60 minutes.
4. **Suppositories are an effective alternative** when vomiting is persistent or oral administration is impossible. Dosage is the same as oral.
5. **Always shake suspensions, store at room temperature**, and respect shelf life after opening (commercial: 6 months, hospital-dispensed: 1 month).
6. For accurate weight-based dosing, use the [dosage calculator](/en).
