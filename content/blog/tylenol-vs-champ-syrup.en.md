faqs:
  - question: "Are Tylenol and Champ Syrup (Red) the same medicine?"
    answer: "Yes, both contain acetaminophen 32mg/mL — identical active ingredient and concentration. Only the manufacturer differs (Tylenol by Janssen Korea, Champ by Dong-A Pharmaceutical). Because they are the same drug, taking both simultaneously would cause an overdose."
  - question: "What is the difference between Champ Red and Champ Yellow?"
    answer: "Champ Red contains acetaminophen (a fever reducer/pain reliever), while Champ Yellow is a cold medicine (containing chlorpheniramine + pseudoephedrine). They have completely different ingredients and purposes. Champ Yellow is NOT a fever reducer."
  - question: "Can I give Tylenol and Champ Red together?"
    answer: "Absolutely not. Both products contain acetaminophen, so taking them together would be a double dose, risking liver damage. Choose only one. Also check cold medicines for hidden acetaminophen content."

## A Moment of Confusion at the Pharmacy

When Yunseul was about a year old, she spiked a fever in the middle of the night. I frantically checked her temperature, went to give her Tylenol, and found the bottle was empty. The next morning I rushed to the pharmacy and asked for Tylenol, but the pharmacist said:

"We're out of Tylenol right now, but would **Champ Syrup** be okay? It's the same ingredient."

"Champ Syrup? What is that?" Even as a doctor, I paused for a moment. Of course, one look at the active ingredient label and I knew the answer, but an unfamiliar brand name can give anyone a moment of doubt.

An even more common scenario goes like this: You get Champ Syrup prescribed at the pediatrician, but you already have a bottle of Tylenol at home. When the fever spikes, which one do you give? Can you give both? Can you alternate between them?

The short answer: **these two products are essentially identical medications**. And precisely because they are identical, there is something critical you must be careful about.

## The Bottom Line: They Are the Same Drug

> **Children's Tylenol and Champ Syrup (Red) have the same active ingredient, same concentration, and same dosing guidelines.**

| Parameter | Children's Tylenol | Champ Syrup (Red) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Active Ingredient | Acetaminophen | Acetaminophen |
| Concentration | 32mg/mL | 32mg/mL |
| Dose per administration | 10-15mg/kg | 10-15mg/kg |
| Minimum age | 4 months | 4 months |
| Dosing interval | At least 4 hours | At least 4 hours |
| Max doses per day | 5 | 5 |
| Max daily dose | 75mg/kg/day | 75mg/kg/day |
| Max single dose | 650mg | 650mg |

As you can see, **not a single number is different.**

The natural follow-up question: "So what IS different?"

## What Makes Them Different?

### Difference 1: Manufacturer

- **Tylenol**: Janssen Korea (Johnson & Johnson subsidiary)
- **Champ Syrup**: Dong-A Pharmaceutical

The manufacturer is different, but the active ingredient (acetaminophen) and its concentration are identical. Think of it like a brand-name drug versus a generic. If you are in the US, this is the same concept as choosing between brand-name Tylenol and store-brand acetaminophen (CVS, Walgreens, or Walmart brand). The active ingredient and concentration are the same; only the label and price differ.

### Difference 2: Flavor

- **Tylenol**: Strawberry flavor
- **Champ Syrup (Red)**: Cherry flavor

One of the most frustrating moments when giving fever medicine is when your child spits it out because they don't like the taste. Yunseul always took Tylenol without a fuss, but I have heard from other parents that their child refused Tylenol but happily took Champ Syrup. Every child has different taste preferences, so if one product is rejected, you can try the other.

### Difference 3: Price

Tylenol is generally slightly more expensive due to its long-established brand recognition. However, prices vary by pharmacy and retailer, so this is not a hard rule.

### Difference 4: Availability

- **Tylenol**: Available at pharmacies and in some markets at convenience stores (high accessibility)
- **Champ Syrup**: Primarily available at pharmacies or through hospital prescriptions

When you urgently need fever medicine at 3 AM, Tylenol's wider retail availability can be an advantage.

## The Most Important Warning: NEVER Give Both Together!

> **Tylenol + Champ Red = Double dose of acetaminophen = Risk of overdose!**

Because these two products have **the same active ingredient at the same concentration**, they must never be used together.

- **Giving Tylenol and then Champ Red within 4 hours** = double dosing with the same ingredient
- **Splitting the dose: "half Tylenol, half Champ"** = makes calculation unnecessarily complicated and increases the risk of error
- **Choosing one product and using it consistently** = the correct approach

Acetaminophen is extremely safe at recommended doses, but **overdosing can cause serious liver damage**. The daily maximum of 75mg/kg/day must not be exceeded, and using two different products makes it difficult to track the total amount given.

### A Real-World Scenario

Imagine Grandma has Champ Syrup at her house, and Mom has Tylenol at home. Grandma gives Champ Syrup in the morning, and Mom gives Tylenol in the afternoon. Both think, "I only gave one dose of fever medicine." But because the products have different names, neither may realize they contain the same active ingredient.

The result: **the same acetaminophen is given twice without even maintaining the 4-hour interval.**

> **When multiple caregivers are involved, always share what medicine was given, the exact ingredient name, and what time it was given.** Get in the habit of checking the active ingredient, not just the brand name.

This same principle applies in the US when families keep multiple acetaminophen products at home: brand-name Tylenol, store-brand acetaminophen, and combination cold medicines that contain acetaminophen. Always check the active ingredient list.

## The Champ Brand: Different Colors Mean Completely Different Medicines

The Dong-A Pharmaceutical "Champ" brand includes more than just fever reducers. **Each color represents a completely different active ingredient and purpose.**

### Champ Fever Reducers (2 Products)

| Parameter | Champ Syrup (Red) | Champ Ibuprofen Syrup (Blue) |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Active Ingredient | **Acetaminophen** | **Ibuprofen** |
| Drug Class | Non-opioid analgesic/antipyretic | NSAID |
| Concentration | 32mg/mL | 20mg/mL |
| Minimum age | 4 months | 6 months |
| Dosing interval | At least 4 hours | At least 6 hours |
| Max doses per day | 5 | 3-4 |

### Champ Non-Fever Products -- Do Not Confuse!

| Product | Purpose | Is it a fever reducer? |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| Champ Nose Syrup | Cold medicine (runny nose, congestion) | No |
| Champ Cough | Cough medicine | No |
| Champ Cold | Multi-symptom cold medicine | No |

> **Even though they all carry the "Champ" name, only Red and Blue are fever reducers.** The other Champ products treat cold symptoms and are NOT antipyretics. Always check the product name and active ingredients.

Here is the key takeaway:

- **Champ Red (Champ Syrup)** = same active ingredient as Tylenol (acetaminophen 32mg/mL)
- **Champ Blue (Champ Ibuprofen Syrup)** = same active ingredient as Motrin/Advil (ibuprofen 20mg/mL)

Once you understand these relationships, the safety of combinations becomes clear:

- **Champ Red + Champ Blue alternating** = same as alternating Tylenol + Motrin (may be considered after consulting a doctor)
- **Champ Red + Tylenol** = double dose of acetaminophen (absolutely prohibited!)
- **Champ Blue + Motrin/Advil** = double dose of ibuprofen (absolutely prohibited!)

Judge by the **active ingredient name**, not the product brand.

## Which Should You Choose?

Medically, there is no difference in effectiveness between the two products. Choose whichever is more practical for your situation.

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Need to buy at a pharmacy quickly | Tylenol (widely available) |
| Child refuses the taste of Tylenol | Try Champ Red |
| Prescribed by the pediatrician | Use the prescribed product |
| Price is a consideration | Champ Red (generally less expensive) |

> **From a medical perspective, either choice is equally effective.** Pick the one your child will take more easily.

However, once you choose a product, **stick with it consistently until the fever resolves**. Switching mid-course increases the risk of dosing confusion.

## Summary

1. Children's Tylenol and Champ Red have the **same active ingredient (acetaminophen) and same concentration (32mg/mL)**
2. The only differences are manufacturer, flavor, and price. The effectiveness is identical
3. **Never give both products together** -- double dosing with the same ingredient risks liver damage
4. Champ fever reducers come in only **two varieties: Red (acetaminophen) and Blue (ibuprofen)** -- other Champ products are cold medicines
5. When multiple caregivers are involved, **always share the medication name, active ingredient, and dosing times**
6. For accurate dosing, enter your child's weight in our [dosage calculator](/en)
